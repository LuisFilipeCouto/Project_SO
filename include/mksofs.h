     * \brief Computes the structural partition of the disk
     * \details
     *   Based on the total number of blocks of the disk (\c ntotal) and
     *   on the number of inodes (\c itotal) proposed, 
     *   computes the structural partition, that is, the actual number of inodes,
     *   the number of data blocks and the number blocks for the reference table,
     *   taking into account the following:
     *   - \c itotal must be rounded up to a multiple of \c IPB;
     *   - \c itotal must be rounded up to a multiple of \c 32;
     *   - \c itotal must be lower than or equal to the rounded up value of <tt>ntotal/8</tt>
     *   - \c itotal must be greater than or equal to \c IPB
     *   - if, at entry, the proposed value for \c itotal is 0,
     *     value <tt>ntotal/16</tt> should be used
     *   - for every free data block (all but one),
     *     there must exist a reference in the retrieval cache
     *     or in the reference table
     *   - If, after making the partition, a spare block remains, it should be assigned
     *     to the inode table
     *   .
